1) There is a non-binary, tree with cycles written on the whiteboard. Each node has an integer value. 
   - write BFS algorithm, each node is visited just once
   - write DFS algorithm prioritizing child nodes by their value (lowest are visited first)   
   
2) An array of ints [ 1, 5, -12, 5, 7, ...] is given
   - write an algorithm to determine lowest and highest value
   - write an algorithm to determine average   
   - what is the time and space complexity of your alogirthms?
   - bonus question: write an algorithm to determine median - what is time and space complexity ?
